**Raspberry Pi GPIO Control with Linux Kernel Module (LKM)**

Welcome to the RPi-GPIO-LKM repository! This project showcases a partially completed Linux Kernel Module (LKM) designed to control GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. It‚Äôs a learning journey into kernel programming, aimed at enthusiasts and developers interested in low-level hardware control on embedded systems.

**Project Overview**

This repository contains a Linux Kernel Module that interacts with the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi. The goal was to create a robust kernel-level driver to toggle GPIO pins, but due to academic commitments, the project is currently paused with partial functionality. The module compiles and loads successfully, with basic GPIO control implemented, though further refinements (e.g., advanced pin configurations or user-space interfaces) are pending.

**Why This Repository?**

**Learn Kernel Programming:** Dive into the world of LKMs with a practical example targeting Raspberry Pi GPIO.

**Replicate My Setup:** Follow the detailed commands in COMMANDS.md to set up, compile, and test the module.

**Understand the Theory:** Read THEORY.md for an in-depth explanation of the project‚Äôs design and challenges.

**Contribute or Extend:** Fork this repo to continue where I left off or use it as a foundation for your own LKM projects.

**üìÇ Repository Structure**

**gpio_lkm.c:** The LKM source code for GPIO control (partially functional).

**Makefile:** Build script for compiling the kernel module.

**THEORY.md:** Explains the project‚Äôs objectives, LKM concepts, and current progress.

**COMMANDS.md:** Lists all commands used to set up, compile, and test the module.

**üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started**

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/RPi-GPIO-LKM.git


Set Up Your Raspberry Pi: Ensure you have a Raspberry Pi with a compatible Linux kernel (tested on Raspberry Pi OS).
Follow the Commands: Check COMMANDS.md for step-by-step instructions to build and test the module.
Read the Theory: Visit THEORY.md to understand the project‚Äôs background and design.

**üîß Current Status**

**Achievements:**

LKM compiles and loads successfully.
Basic GPIO pin control (e.g., setting pins high/low) is implemented.


**Limitations:**

Limited error handling and advanced features (e.g., interrupts, sysfs integration).
Partial testing due to time constraints.


**Why Paused?:** Academic commitments have temporarily halted progress, but I plan to resume in the future!

**ü§ù Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Whether it‚Äôs fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature).
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m "Add your feature").
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Please read THEORY.md before contributing to align with the project‚Äôs vision.
